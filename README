This is a Munin plugin for Redis.

It tries to extensively cover Redis INFO output, while keeping the
dependencies low (currently, only needs awk and redis-cli).

It can monitor several Redis instances, remotes or locals to the server.

To install : just copy the redis_ script to your $MUNIN_LIBDIR
(on Debian, that's /usr/share/munin/plugins/).

Then create a symbolic link like this:

  ln -s '/usr/share/munin/plugins/redis_' \
        '/etc/munin/plugins/redis_127.0.0.1_6379'

Or let "munin-node-configure --shell | bash" do it for you.

To monitor remote servers (or monitor local Redis instances listening
on non-defaults ports), create a symbolic link accordingly, ie. :
/etc/munin/plugins/redis_remoteserverip_remoteserverport

Passwords can be set in a config file ala /etc/munin/plugin-conf.d/redis:

[redis]
 env.password secret-password

and/or

[redis_remoteserverip_remoteserverport]
 env.passwod another-secret-password
