This is a Munin plugin for Redis.

It tries to extensively covers Redis INFO output, while keeping the
dependencies low (currently, only needs awk and redis-cli).

To install : just copy the redis shell script in /etc/munin/plugins/
and restart munin-node.

To monitor a remote server, rename the script (or create a symlink)
accordingly, ie. :
/etc/munin/plugins/redis_remoteserverip_remoteserverport .
